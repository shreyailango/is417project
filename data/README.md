#IS417 PROJECT DATA

This folder contains the character data set that we will be using for our code. It contains details about characters in novels through different decades.

The files are too large to be uploaded on github, so we will add the links here. It might be easier to download the files into the data folder and then test the code.
1) https://github.com/tedunderwood/noveltmmeta/blob/master/metadata/titlemeta.tsv
2) https://github.com/tedunderwood/character/blob/master/metadata/filtered_fiction_plus_18c.tsv
3) https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZM2MAN to get the character data files.
